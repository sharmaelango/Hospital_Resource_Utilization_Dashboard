# Hospital Resource Utilization & Patient Outcomes Dashboard

## Project Status
Step 1 Completed: Synthetic Dataset Generation

## Description
This project focuses on building an analytics dashboard for hospital operations to monitor patient flow, resource utilization, and outcomes across departments and branches.

Due to healthcare data privacy constraints, a fully synthetic dataset has been generated to simulate real-world hospital operations.

## Dataset
The following synthetic datasets have been created:
- patients.csv
- admissions.csv
- doctors.csv
- doctor_schedule.csv
- procedures.csv
- billing.csv
- outcomes.csv
- beds.csv

These datasets will be used in later steps for database loading, backend API creation, and BI dashboard development.

## Next Steps
- Load datasets into PostgreSQL
- Build FastAPI backend for KPIs
- Create Power BI / Superset dashboards
