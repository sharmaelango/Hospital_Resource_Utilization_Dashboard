# Hospital Resource Utilization & Patient Outcomes Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project aims to build an interactive analytics dashboard for hospital operations teams to monitor and optimize resource utilization, patient flow, and outcomes across departments and branches.

Due to healthcare data privacy constraints, all datasets used in this project are fully synthetic and generated using realistic hospital operational assumptions.
